#Part 1
##Approach 1
A function doubleL is created and takes an integer 'n' as an argument. First, inside doubleL an empty list called 'res' is intialized with no values using an empty set of square brackets. Then, we use a for range loop (with one agrument, meaning we loop starting from 0 up to but not including 'n'). For each loop iteration we append to our 'res' list the integer times 2, for all integers 0 to n-1 inclusive. Once our 'res' list is populated, doubleL then returns this list.
Using this function, we can treat doubleL(5) directly as all values 0-4 multiplied by 2 stored in a list. Looping over each list element, we simply print each element with an ending of " : " to separate our values visually.

##Approach 2
We use list comprehension to create a list of values multiplied by 2. These values are represented with 'n'. For every 'n' we have in the range from 0-5 exclusive (since the range function excludes the stop value and assumes the start is 0 if only one argument is provided), we multiply it by 2 and the result is stored in the list. Then, using a for loop to iterate over the elements in the list generated with list comprehension, we print each element with an ending of " : " to separate the values visually.

##Approach 3
A generator function doubleG is created and takes an integer 'n' as an argument. Using a for range loop we iterate the amount of times starting from 0 up to 'n' exclusive. Each iteration we then yield the value multiplied by 2, suspending the function temporarily so we can resume at this same point later, producing a sequence of the resultant values.
Using this function, we use a for loop to iterate over the value sequence produced by doubleG(5). For each value 'i', we print it with an ending of " : " to  separate the values visually.

#Part 2
doubleG(n) is a generator function. The advantage of using this type of a function is that it is memory efficient. The yield keyword pauses function execution and allows us to return to that same part later, meaning the values in the sequence are generated one at a time and when it is needed. This is better when compared to creating a list of all values at one time and then having them stored in memory. Because we only get the values as needed, it results in faster processing and is highly ideal when the datasets or sequences are much larger.
